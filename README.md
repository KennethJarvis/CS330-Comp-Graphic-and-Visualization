How do I approach designing software?
	I approach designing software by first setting up my IDE with all the libraries and extra files needed to perform the functions required. I also have a detailed plan drawn out before creating code. 
 
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
This project has helped me learn many new skills with transformations, textures, 3D graphics, and lighting. I worked with each one, then combined them to create a 3D scene. 

What design process did you follow for your project work?
I used a design the I have premade on paper and start at the most logical area first and build from there. For example, in my final project for the course, I started by building a plane, then built objects on the plane one by one.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
Tactics I can you in the future is work on one portion of the project at a time. Constantly run the program to make everything is working with simple code before moving to more complex scenarios. This strategy helps eliminate reasons why errors are occurring and allows me to focus on the project at hand. 

How do I approach developing programs?
I like to approach developing programs by researching every aspect of the project. I document a plan and adjust when something unforeseen happens. The more programs I do of the same nature become easier over time since I retained a good portion of the information from the prior project.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
First, I like to document clear goals and identify who may be using the program. I then research the ways I can achieve those goals and decided on the best course of action given all the variables. When completed, I test evaluate my product for improvement that can be made. I ask the users that will be using the program if there is anything that would make the program better. 

How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration factors in by repeating a set of steps. The more you stick to something that works and build from there, the faster a developer can become. Trying out new things isn’t bad practice either, but needs to come in incremental development. 

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
The approach in my milestone prepared me for my final by giving me all the essential information and practice needed to complete my work. The final had many working parts, and by dividing those parts into smaller sections and working in an order that allows me to see the project progress in one motion. In the end, I can see the finished project and I remember the steps needed to get there.

 How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science teaches me different techniques to solve problems. Whether it is security, programming, IT etc., my courses teach me that I may not know the answers right away, but I can diagnose a problem and narrow down possible solutions quickly. 

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Before this class, all my programming had been text based. I never used graphics as I didn’t understand it too well. Now, I have an understanding of how to create objects to complement my code. This class opened a new world of design I can learn from. 

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
There aren’t too many programs out there that only use text results. There is usually is some form of gui used to give the program some design. And I found that the better the design of the program, the easier it is for the user to interact. Graphics and visualizations are essential to a quality program meant for people to use.
